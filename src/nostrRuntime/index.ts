/**
 * NostrRuntime - Centralized Nostr subscription and event storage
 *
 * Main API for interacting with Nostr events in the application.
 * Provides:
 * - Centralized event storage with multi-index queries
 * - Automatic subscription deduplication
 * - Simple query interface for components
 * - Integration with existing SimplePool and Throttler systems
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * import { nostrRuntime } from './singletons';
 *
 * // Query cached events (synchronous, no network)
 * const profiles = nostrRuntime.query({ kinds: [0], authors: ['pubkey'] });
 *
 * // Subscribe to events (network + cache)
 * const handle = nostrRuntime.subscribe(
 *   ['wss://relay.example.com'],
 *   [{ kinds: [1], limit: 100 }],
 *   {
 *     onEvent: (event) => console.log('New event:', event),
 *     onEose: () => console.log('Subscription ready'),
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Clean up
 * handle.unsubscribe();
 * ```
